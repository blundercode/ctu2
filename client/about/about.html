<h1 class="title"><b>ABOUT</b></h1>
<p>Come Teach Us is a Full Stack (MEAN) web application that enables developers with coding questions to get answers from other developers. It provides users the ability to post questions, answer questions, or join a live video chatroom where a question is already being answered. The chatroom is powered by WebRTC and includes live video, audio, screen-sharing and chat.

<p>The idea for the site originated from one of our team members based on his previous experience with the technology WebRTC.
